  I was born in Guyana, a beautiful country located on the extreme North of South America and is known as the Land of Many Waters.

In, September, 2008 I graduation from the University of Pinar Del Rio, Cuba with a BSc. in Telecommunication and Electronics Engineering. I am since been employed at the Ministry of Agriculture as a telecommunication engineer. My duties includes the installation, calibration and maintenance of the entire range of hydrometeorological electronic, electro-mechanical and telecommunication equipment such as the Automatic Weather Stations and Doppler Weather Radar. As part of my duties as Supervisor of the Telecommunications/Maintenance Section, I continuously teach staff under my supervision about the technologies used within the Hydrometeorological Department to ensure that our day to day mandates are met in an efficient manner.

Due my tenure at the Ministry, I have assisted with the installation and configuration of equipment for early warning systems under the Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and Caribbean Community Climate Change Centre (CCCCC) projects that are being implemented throughout Guyana and the Caribbean Region.  This involves coordinating and sharing technical advice with professionals throughout the region. Data from this network of early warning systems will be used as the tool for activation of the Disaster Risk Management plans for the stakeholder countries.
